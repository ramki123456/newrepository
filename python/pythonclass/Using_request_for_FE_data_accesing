1. We have used "request" keyword in all view functions.
2. Let's see how it works.

1. request is used for accesing the data which entered in FE.
2. While accessing the PDB, use n for next line, c for continue, s- step in

Now while printing the request, we can get a WSGI object as an output.

Now request.method will return a Query Objects which includes a dictionary in it. So access the dictionary now to use the form data in Views.py. Here method can be either GET or POST.


How to access the data from dictionary.


Assume below is my dictionary.

d = {'user': 'Hari', 'pwd': 'Kanna'}

# Use Keying process or get method in dictionaries to access the data.

print d['user']  ==> 'Hari'

# in above example if the key is not available in dictionary will return "Key Error"

To avoid that, always use "get" ,method in Dictionary.

print d.get('user')  ==>  It will return "None" if the key is not available.
