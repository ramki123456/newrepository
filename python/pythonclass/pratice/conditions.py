#conditions:- to handle the conditional behavior in python will use conditional blocks.
# python three types of coditional blocks they are
# 1.if 2.if-else 3.elif
# to write a block of statements in python use indentation
# every block should starts with :
# the set of statements in block should maintain unit no of spaces.
#syntax: 
#if condition:
#		statements
#if condition:
#	stmts
#else:
#	stmts
