# TUPLES : the group of elements which are enclosed within two paranthesis is known as tuple.
#           Here elements are seperated by ', '.
#           Tuples are ordered data structures so we can perform indexing and slicng operations.
#           Tuples are IMMUTABLE data structures, So we can't perform altering or modification operations.
#          Theoritically we can't modify a tuple but in some special situations like placing a mutable object we can modify a Tuple.

#              Syntax :  variable_name = (ele1, ele2, ele3,.....)

             l = (1,2,3,"bharath")
#>>> l
(1, 2, 3, 'bharath')
 l = (1,2,3, [4,5])
 l[3][1] = 25
 #l
#(1, 2, 3, [4, 25])


## *** only count and index are the two methods we can perform in Tuples  ****
